# Quantum Hardware Calibration
## Project Description
### Overview
Quantum Hardware devices operate with many physical parameters, but the influences of many of them are still not fully understood. To start, we could use the IBM 1-qubit open-source device and record its performance by testing various algorithms, given different hardware parameters (e.g. frequency, voltage, etc.). The key is to study the influence of different parameters and find the best combination, taking error/fidelity rate into account.
### Group Size
3-5 people, semester-long project
### Objectives
* Understand the basic constructions of quantum hardware devices
* We could get help from Prof. Haeffner with his extensive knowledge on quantum hardware
* Design an procedure to find the best combination of parameters for a hardware quantum device that optimizes its performance

### Challenges
* Most group members do not have experience with quantum hardware devices
* The access and utilization of the open-source device is still unknown
