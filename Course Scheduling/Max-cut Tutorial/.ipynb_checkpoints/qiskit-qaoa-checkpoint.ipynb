The graph will be defined below and corresponds to the native connectivity of the divice. This allows us to implement the original version of the $QAOA$ algorithm, where the cost - function $C$ and the Hamiltonian $H$ that is used to generate the state coincide. Moreover, for such a simple graph the exact cost function can be calculated analytically. To implement the circuit, we follow the notation and gate defintions from the [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)."
